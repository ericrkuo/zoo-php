## Setting up the repo

> Important: these steps assume you're using the cs department servers

1. Clone the repo **inside** the `~/public_html` directory. This way we do not need to keep copy and pasting our PHP files back and forth between the repo and the public directory.
2. Create a copy of `environment.sample.php` and rename to `environment.php`. 
     - Fill in the environment variables with your correct CWL and student number
     - Note these are the exact same credentials used in tutorial 7 in the php file
2. Go to https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~(CWL_ID)/zoo-php/zoo.php to see the file
     - notice how it uses our repo directory in the URL
